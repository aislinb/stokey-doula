        <p>I am a birth and postpartum doula and KGHypnobirthing teacher based in Stoke Newington, Hackney in London. Born and bred up the road in Highbury, I live with my husband, one year old daughter and our dog, and can often be seen walking around Hackney’s many green spaces with them.

I began my training as a doula with Nurturing Birth Doulas in June 2019 following the birth of my daughter in 2018. Her birth came after several years of infertility, IVF and pregnancy loss. Once I was ready to believe that I finally was going to have a baby, I put everything into finding out all that I could about pregnancy and birth. I undertook Active Birth and Hypnobirthing courses and practiced the techniques. I was determined to not let the birth of my child be defined by the medical intervention that defined her conception. As IVF pregnancies are often categorised as ‘high risk’, this was not straightforward. However, I did end up having an extremely positive birth experience, one that I believe may not have been possible if I hadn’t prepared in the way that I did and if I had not armed myself with the knowledge of the legal rights that we all have in birth (having over a decade of advocating for others as a human rights lawyer may have helped). After the birth, I immediately knew that I was not ready to leave that world behind and wanted to support others going through pregnancy, birth and new parenthood. Due to my infertility journey, I feel particularly privileged to have experienced being pregnant and giving birth, and I know how important this experience is for many.

My interest in everything birth-related feels unending and I am constantly developing myself by undertaking mentoring with Abuela Doulas, training to be a KGHypnobirthing Teacher, being a volunteer mentor with Bump Buddies of the Shoreditch Trust and attending relevant courses.

Since March 2020 I have also been running a free virtual meet-up for anyone in Hackney and the surrounding areas who is expecting a baby or who has recently had a baby. I provide support to the group as a whole and to individuals as needed. See ‘what I offer’ if you are interested in joining.</p>
        <h3 className="subheading">HIRING A DOULA</h3>
        <p>
When I became a doula, it was with the intention of empowering the people I would work with, allowing them to make the right decisions for them and enhancing their experience of birth and/or post-partum. For me, the key is feeling heard, supported and strong, no matter what your birth looks like and who you are.

There has been various research that supports the assertion that there are real benefits to hiring a doula; you can access these here. As someone who spent over a decade working in human rights law, I would not have become a doula if I didn’t strongly believe that the potential benefits for those supported by a doula were significant. This is particularly in the context of an incredible but burdened NHS which, in many instances, is struggling to provide individuals with the continuity of care and in-depth support that they would like to.

As your doula, it is my role to provide you with access to information that will prepare you for birth and post-partum. It is my role to listen to and support you in your choices, no matter what they are. It is my role to be on hand with emotional and practical support during your pregnancy, labour and immediately after birth. It is my role to provide you with continuity of care. If you need me to be your advocate, then I will be your advocate.

I strongly believe that an adult, who is informed and of sound mind, should be supported to have whatever birth they choose for themselves and their baby, and further that they have the right to change their mind about what they want or what is right for them at any time. You may want an elective caesarean, or you may plan a drug-free homebirth, or even free birth: it is your decision and no one else has the right to try to control what you decide to do.

It is essential to me, and hopefully to you too, that if you choose me as your doula it is because we (including any partner you may have) work well together, and it feels right. I want you to be able to trust me and feel completely comfortable in my presence, after all if we work together then I will likely be there in one of the most life-changing moments you will ever experience. With this in mind, if you are interested then don’t hesitate to get in touch for a relaxed initial chat.
